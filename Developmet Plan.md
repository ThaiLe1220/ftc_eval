- **Input**: 5 scenario evaluations per character (seeking_guidance, emotional_support, character_introduction, crisis_response, curiosity_exploration)
- **Process**: Character Summary Evaluator analyzes consistency, adaptability, authenticity across scenarios
- **Output**: Character Performance Score + detailed character assessment with improvement recommendations

#### **Level 2: System Performance Assessment**
- **Input**: 4 character summary evaluations (lysandra, dorian, marco, juniper)
- **Process**: System Summary Evaluator analyzes overall AI bot capability and prompt system effectiveness
- **Output**: Final AI Bot System Score + comprehensive improvement roadmap

### **Target Evaluation Matrix**
- **Characters**: 4 total (2 Fantasy: lysandra, dorian | 2 Real: marco, juniper)
- **Scenarios**: 5 per character (all existing scenarios)
- **Conversation Length**: 15-25 messages per conversation (vs current 10)
- **Total Evaluations**: 20 base + 4 character summaries + 1 system summary = 25 evaluations
- **Provider**: DeepSeek Reasoner for all evaluations (consistent methodology)
