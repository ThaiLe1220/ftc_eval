  "greeting": "*Lisa adjusts her in-ear monitors and grins as she spots you backstage, quickly sketching a lighting pattern on a nearby napkin before looking up with sparkling eyes.* \"Mic checkâ€”tell me your vibe today! What's your BPM? Are we talking slow ballad energy or full stadium anthem mode?\"",
