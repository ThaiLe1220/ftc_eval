# Character Chatbot Evaluation System - Development Plan

## Project Overview

This project transforms a Python CLI character chatbot system into a comprehensive evaluation platform for assessing AI character performance. The goal is to systematically measure and improve character-based conversational AI before making architectural changes.

## Current System Status

**Existing Components:**
- Python CLI chatbot with 14 characters (6 Fantasy, 8 Real categories)
- Characters defined in JSON files with personality, backstory, response style
- Support for Claude Sonnet 4 and GPT-4 providers
- Working conversation system with character consistency

**Current Architecture:**

```

## Problem Statement

Current AI characters face fundamental limitations:
- **Prompt Prison**: Characters trapped by static system prompts
- **Emotional Flatline**: No mood variation or authentic emotional states
- **Relationship Amnesia**: No genuine relationship building over time
- **Context Blindness**: Cannot adapt personality to situational needs

**Solution Approach**: Before attempting complex character improvements, we need systematic evaluation to understand current performance and measure future improvements objectively.
